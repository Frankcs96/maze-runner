# Maze runner

Welcome to my first game with libgdx, this is just a small project for testing libgdx<br>

**Hello it's me now in 2022 :P, this was one of my first projects so the code is kinda fun to read but it makes me realize how much I have improved**
**I decided to give some love to this project and update the whole library since it was not compatible with Mac m1**
